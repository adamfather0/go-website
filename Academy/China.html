            <h3>The China Go Association: A Comprehensive Overview</h3>
            <p>Founded on March 15, 1992, the China Go Association is a state-run organization directly under the State
                Sports General Administration. It serves as the central hub for Chinese chess, overseeing training,
                competitions, and the development of go, Chinese chess, and international chess. The association is
                responsible for organizing major domestic and international tournaments, as well as promoting chess
                activities among the general public. In recognition of its significant contributions to the preservation
                of Chinese culture, the association was designated in November 2019 as the protection unit for the
                national intangible cultural heritage item "Chinese chess".</p>

            <h3>The China Go League</h3>
            <p>The China Go League, China's premier professional go league, was established with ten teams in its
                inaugural season. The league format has since evolved to include twelve teams, each competing in a
                home-and-away format over 22 rounds. Notably, the league has attracted a significant number of foreign
                players, particularly from Korea and Japan, enriching the competition and raising its international
                profile.</p>
            <p>The league operates on a promotion and relegation system. The bottom two teams in the A league are
                relegated to the B league, while the top two teams in the B league are promoted to the A league. Since
                2006, the Chinese league champion has faced off against the champion of the Korean league in an annual
                championship match.</p>
