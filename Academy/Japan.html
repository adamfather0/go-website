                        The Nihon Kiin (Nippon Kiin) is Japan's premier go organization, governing and promoting the
                        game of go. With its headquarters in Tokyo, the Nihon Kiin oversees a network of professional go
                        players numbering around 300. To ensure comprehensive coverage of the country, the organization
                        has established regional headquarters in Nagoya and Osaka, serving the Chubu and Kansai regions,
                        respectively.

                    </p>
                    <p>Founded in 1924 through the unification of Honinbo-mon and Hoensha, two influential go
                        organizations of the time, the Nihon Kiin has played a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of
                        Japanese go. Despite facing challenges from rival organizations, the Nihon Kiin has solidified
                        its position as the dominant force in Japanese go. However, a notable split occurred in 1950
                        when a group of Kansai-based players, led by Utar≈ç Hashimoto, seceded to form the Kansai Kiin.

                    <h3>Nihon Kiin Title Matches</h3>
                    <p>
                        The seven major go tournaments in Japan, ranked by prize money, are Kisei, Meijin, Honinbo, Oza,
                        Tengen, Gosei, and Judan. The top three tournaments, Kisei, Meijin, and Honinbo, with the
                        highest prize money, are collectively known as the "Three Great Titles." Among them, Kisei is
                        the highest title. If a player wins all three titles, they are said to have achieved the "Grand
                        Slam."
                    </p>
                    <p>There are many professional go tournaments, but what sets the "Seven Major Titles" apart? The
                        biggest characteristic of the Seven Major Titles is that all professional players are eligible
                        to participate, although the methods for determining challengers vary. In the Meijin and Honinbo
                        tournaments, players must advance to the league stage after qualifying. Reaching the league
                        stage is proof of being a top-level player.</p>
                    <p>Here's a breakdown of the prize money for each title:</p>
