                Korea Baduk Association (Hangul: 한국기원) The Korea Baduk Association is the governing body for
                professional
                Go (Baduk) in South Korea, with its history tracing back to the creation of the Seoul Baduk Association
                by Cho Nam-chul in November 1945.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cho Nam-chul went to Japan in 1937 to study Go under professional player Kitani Minoru, a 9-dan. Upon
                his return to Korea in 1945, he established the Baduk Association. Traditionally, Koreans opened the
                game with black stones. After founding the Korea Baduk Association, Cho convinced Koreans to use white
                stones as the starting color. In 1956, he organized the "Kuksu Championship" to popularize Go in
                society.

                    <h4>Cho Nam-chul</h4>
                    <h5>Cho Nam-chul (Hangul: 조남철, November 30, 1923 – July 2, 2006) was a 9-dan professional Go player
                        known as the father of modern Korean Go.</h5>
                    <p>In 1946, he established the Seoul Baduk Association, marking the formal beginning of professional
                        Go
                        in Korea. In 1950, he organized the first modern Korean Go ranking tournament, with Cho ranked
                        at
                        3-dan and others at 1-dan. In 1955, he persuaded President Syngman Rhee to form a professional
                        Go
                        team and sent them to Taiwan for an international match against local players, where Korea won.
                        This
                        victory boosted national morale and raised Cho's profile in modern Go. Soon after, Korea's
                        professional Go tournaments were established, and in 1968, the Seoul Baduk Association was
                        restructured and renamed the Korea Baduk Association. Cho dominated Korean Go until Kim In
                        returned
                        from studying in Japan and took the lead. He was awarded 9-dan in 1983 and became the oldest
                        player
                        to enter a professional tournament main competition in 1994. His nephew, Cho Chikun, went on to
                        become a top player in Japan.</p>

                    <h4>Lee Chang-ho</h4>
                    <h5>Lee Chang-ho (Hangul: 이창호, born July 29, 1975) is a Go player from Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do, Korea.
                        He is considered the second-generation leader of Korean Go and one of the greatest players in
                        modern Go history.</h5>
                    <p>Lee achieved 1-dan at age 11, just after Cho Hun-hyun's record. At age 15 years and six months,
                        he won his first world championship, setting a record for the youngest world champion. In 1996,
                        the Korea Baduk Association awarded him a promotion from 7-dan to 9-dan. Lee is recognized for
                        his era of dominance from 1996 to 2006, which is known as the "Lee Chang-ho era." Over his
                        career, he has won 17 world championships and 21 international titles, remaining at the top. His
                        career spanned from 1992 to 2012, with a peak between 1996 and 2006. Lee has been nicknamed the
                        "Guardian Spirit" for his performance in international Go team tournaments.</p>

                    <h4>Cho Hun-hyun</h4>
                    <h5>Cho Hun-hyun (Hangul: 조훈현, March 10, 1953) is a renowned Korean Go player, a 9-dan professional
                        in the Korea Baduk Association, and a nine-time world champion. He is considered a pioneer of
                        modern Korean Go and is respected as the "Emperor of Go."</h5>
                    <p>Cho is the mentor of Lee Chang-ho, a record-setting world champion, and the two are famously
                        known as the "Cho-Lee duo." Along with Yoo Chang-hyuk and Seo Bong-soo, they are referred to as
                        the "Four Kings of Korean Go." Born in Mokpo, Jeollanam-do, Cho became the youngest professional
                        player in the association's history (at 9 years and 7 months). In 1963, he went to Japan to
                        study Go under Kensaku Segoe and was promoted to 5-dan by the Japan Go Association in 1972.
                        Returning to Korea for military service, Cho chose to stay and went on to become the Korean Go
                        master, winning over 130 Korean domestic championships. In 1982, he achieved 9-dan. In 1989, he
                        defeated Nie Weiping, a Chinese 9-dan, in the first Ing Cup, sparking a Go craze in Korea.</p>

                    <h4>Lee Se-dol</h4>
                    <h5>Lee Se-dol (Hangul: 이세돌, born March 2, 1983) is a Korean 9-dan professional Go player from
                        Bigeumdo, Sinan County, Jeollanam-do, also known as the "Prodigy of Bigeumdo."</h5>
                    <p>He became famous early on with his impressive domestic performance, earning him the nickname
                        "Unbeatable Prodigy." Known for his sharp and aggressive style, he eventually adopted a
                        versatile playstyle, balancing offense and defense. His playstyle is sometimes called "zombie
                        style" due to his ability to revive seemingly dead stones on the board. He frequently faced
                        Chinese player Gu Li in matches from 2005 to 2010, and their rivalry attracted much attention.
                        In 2016, he famously faced Google's AlphaGo software in a best-of-five series, winning one match
                        and demonstrating that humans could still compete against AI.</p>
