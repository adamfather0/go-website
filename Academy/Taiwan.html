            <h3>About Haifeng </h3>
            <p> In 1997, Mr. Lin Wenbo, driven by his passion for Go, decided to donate thirty million NT dollars to
                establish a foundation dedicated to promoting Go. After consulting with national Go player Lin Haifeng,
                who gave his full support and agreed to serve as the first chairman, the "Haifeng Cultural and
                Educational Foundation" was established, initiating its mission to promote Go. Due to the significant
                financial and manpower requirements for organizing professional and amateur competitions, the Haifeng
                Foundation has been substantially supported by Chairman Lin Wenbo over the years, leading to rapid
                growth. However, the scope of professional competitions was still insufficient, necessitating
                organizational adjustments. Chairman Lin decided to merge the "Haifeng Cultural and Educational
                Foundation" into the "Peison Cultural and Educational Foundation" to leverage synergies. </p>
            <p> The Peison Cultural and Educational Foundation, another corporate entity funded by Chairman Lin Wenbo
                and his family, has been actively involved in special education. With more abundant resources than the
                Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation, the merger allowed the Haifeng Foundation to hand over the
                promotion of Go to the Peison Foundation. The staff of the original Haifeng Foundation were also
                reorganized to meet the needs of Go promotion, forming the "Haifeng Go Institute" to continue working on
                the front lines of Go promotion. </p>
