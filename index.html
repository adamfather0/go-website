            <h3>Some facts about Go：</h3>
            <p>
                It is said that the game of Go was invented around 2300 BC by Emperor Yao,
                who created it to cultivate the temperament of his son, Dan Zhu. Dan Zhu was prideful,
                arrogant, and impulsive, prompting his father to invent Go as a means to refine his character.

            </p>
        
            <p>
                Go features two types of pieces, black and white, with the player holding the black pieces going first.
                Players alternately place their pieces on the intersections of a grid consisting of nineteen horizontal
                and vertical lines. Once a piece is placed, it cannot be moved or removed except through capture.
                The game proceeds by capturing territory and opponent pieces, with victory determined by the amount of
                "territory"
                enclosed.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The rules of Go are simple and elegant, yet the gameplay is incredibly diverse and complex.
                Mastery of the game requires extensive practice and study. The grandmaster of chess, Emanuel Lasker,
                praised it, saying, "If there are intelligent beings in the universe, they must play Go."
                Go is considered one of the most complex board games in the world, a complexity that was proven
                to be PSPACE-hard by Robertson and Munro in 1978.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                As of mid-2008, there were more than 40 million Go players worldwide, with the vast majority in East
                Asia.
                By the end of 2020, the International Go Federation had 77 member nations and 5 associate members.
            </p>

            <h3>Modern Go:</h3>
            <p> After the Meiji Restoration, professional Go players lost the support of the shogunate
                and began seeking new means of livelihood, leading to the emergence of newspaper Go tournaments
                and the modern dan ranking system, and the establishment of the national Japan Go Association.
                In the Showa era, Go Seigen and Minoru Kitani initiated the "New Fuseki" movement,
                ushering in the era of modern Go. Subsequently, top-class players emerged from the Japanese Go scene,
                such as Eio Sakata, Hideyuki Fujisawa, Gosei Toshiro, and later heroes like Hideo Otake,
                Yoshio Ishida, Masaki Takemiya, and Kōichi Kobayashi.
            </p>
        
            <p> In 1989, Korean player Cho Hunhyun won the first Ing Cup World Go Championship,
                sparking a Go craze in Korea. Subsequently, a plethora of world Go tournaments appeared.
                Among these, Lee Chang-ho from Korea emerged as the top player of the time. After 2006,
                Lee Chang-ho’s performance declined, and new talents like Lee Sedol and Gu Li began to
                challenge his dominance. The following years were marked by the rivalry between Gu Li and Lee Sedol.
            </p>
        
            <p> In the 2010s, many Chinese players rose to prominence, including Jiang Weijie, Fan Tingyu,
                Shi Yue, Mi Yuting, Chen Yaoye, Zhou Ruiyang, and Tan Xiao, who successively won world
                championship titles.
            </p>

            <h3>Go Culture:</h3>
            <p> Over thousands of years of its dissemination, Go has gradually developed numerous technical terms,
                some of which have entered common vocabulary, such as "shoukuan" (endgame). Almost every move in
                Go has a corresponding technical term, and it is even possible to describe a local skirmish
                entirely in text.
            </p>
        
            <p>For example, "Black occupies the star point in the upper right corner,
                White plays a small knight's move, Black plays a high approach two spaces away, White jumps one space
                , Black follows by jumping, White makes a small knight's move into the corner,
                Black blocks at the 3-3 point..." This passage vividly describes a common joseki using Go terminology.
                Common terms include:</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Atari : </strong>When a stone has only one liberty, it is said to be in atari. Also known as
                    "being ataried."</li>
                <li> <strong>Liberty : </strong> The empty intersections directly adjacent to a stone. A single stone
                    cannot have more
                    than four liberties, but connected stones may have more than four liberties. Playing a stone that
                    immediately reduces the opponent's liberties is called "putting in atari." </li>
                <li> <strong>Capture : </strong>Stones without liberties are removed from the board, known as
                    "capturing." </li>
                <li><strong>Eye : </strong> Empty intersections surrounded by one player’s stones on the Go board are
                    called "eyes."</li>
                <li><strong>Territory : </strong> The total number of empty intersections (eyes) surrounded by living
                    stones and the
                    living stones themselves are called "territory."</li>
                <li><strong>Area : </strong> The region enclosed by stones. </li>
                <li> <strong>Ko : </strong> A situation where both players can alternately capture each other’s stones.
                    Go rules state
                    that during a ko fight, the player whose stone was captured cannot recapture immediately; they
                    must make a move elsewhere to find ko threats, which forces the opponent to respond before they
                    can recapture.
                </li>
            </ul>
